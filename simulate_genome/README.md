2017-04-22: These files were used for the creation of simulated hybridized genomes for the purpose of testing IntroMap and performing ROC analysis.

2017-04-22: Due to the large size of the fasta files generated by makeSimulatedHybrids, only the log files and supporting scripts are hosted here.  If you require the actual sequences, you can re-generate them using the workbook and scripts supplied, or you can contact me directly and I can provide you the complete data set.  Warning: They are quite large and the entire data set is well over 12GB when you include the wgsim generated reads used for alignment.
